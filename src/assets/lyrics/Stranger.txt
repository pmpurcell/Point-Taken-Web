Verse 1:
Another morning. Another couple of pills 
Maybe I’m tired or maybe I’m just sick in the head
I just want to know that I’m still sane
Splash of cold water to the face
Step out out to the world and stare into
Space
Every minute is a fight for survival
Standing for my own defense

Dark thoughts linger as Clouds roll through
Stitch it together and hold it all in
Everything moves without me as I disassociate 
Can anyone tell me how To keep myself from coming undone
My hair’s falling out and my vision is blurred
Can I trade up this life for a better one?

Chorus:
Who is it you see in the mirror
The image never seems to get clearer
Just when I thought I understood
I guess it’s not who I thought I knew

Verse 2:

I just can’t seem to fall asleep
Stare at the ceiling and listen to the house creak
Motivation seems too hard to find
Maybe stress is getting to me
The face in the mirror is looking right through me
It seems to be getting dark outside
