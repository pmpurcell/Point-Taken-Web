Here we go again 
Figure out how to go on 
I thought maybe you’d budge a little 
But I know when I’m wrong 

There’s no case left to state 
Just the stories you create 
Go ahead and tell me how this went 

Chorus: 
So now 
These are the stories you to yourself 
To make it so much better 
When I was towing the line 
Slow down 
Or You’ll trip up on your words 

Be mad all you want 
Yell whatever you feel 
It’s all gonna fall on deaf ears 
There might have been a way to fix this 
But you threw it into the ground 
Shame to see it come to it’s end
But it’d be a crime to see it go on 
Who are you gonna cry to 
Now that I’m no longer around 

Chorus: 
So now 
These are the stories you to yourself 
To make it so much better 
When I was towing the line 
Slow down 
Or You’ll trip up on your words
